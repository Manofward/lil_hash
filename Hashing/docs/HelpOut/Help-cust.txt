You can do the follwing with this command:

cust "input value"

with cust you can hash an input you make
for example: 
	cust hallo

with this you would hash hallo



cust "input value" "number"

with this command you say how long the hash should be
it is Important to know that you should go only with whole numbers 
that are bigger than 0 and not over 64 because your computer 
could be forcefully shut off and potentialy damage it 

i can't give you a clear example of how the hash looks because 
it changes every time because of a salt that makes it random
